WHAT DOES CONTAINERS.JS DO?

This is a open source art project enabling the user to create a container / or reduce any webpage to its bare bones. All imgs and media are replaced with empty boxes, and text replaced with spaces (&nbsp;), this transforms the site into a shell for the now non-existent content, but without completely collapsing the site enabling you to see the container / shell / graphics / boxes / the frame of the site. 

Results will be documented here:

www.containersproject.org

Please submit your 'container' images there.
